# Game Engine

## Basic Rules
so after some tinkering I decided (probably rather stupidly) that there should just be a global GameScreen variable that the developer can resize, named (usefully) `gameScreen`.
if you want to resize it, you have to use the function `.resize()` on the gameScreen variable.
