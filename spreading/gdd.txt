GAME DESIGN DOCUMENT FOR A GAME ABOUT SOMETHING ABOUT SPREADING!!!


basic ideas:
- zombie game, but you are the zombie
- you play as a virus infecting a guy's body
- your grandma died and you're tasked with spreading the ashes
- a person inhales their grandmas ashes by accident and they get an infection, and the bacteria you play as looks like their zombie grandma
