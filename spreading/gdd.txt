GAME DESIGN DOCUMENT FOR A GAME ABOUT SOMETHING ABOUT SPREADING!!!

idea: a person inhales their grandmas ashes by accident and they get an infection, and the bacteria you play as looks like their zombie grandma

at the beginning of the game it looks like the game is about spreading ashes, but you trip and inhale the ashes and you have to kill this guy 
as the ashes of his dead grandma, with each level being its own organ, and the mario tunnel equivilent would be the bloodstream
